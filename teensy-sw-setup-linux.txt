Using Teensy boot loader on kali linux
Simple steps to resolve issue of error message:
“Teensy did not respond to a USB-based request to enter program mode.”

1. Copy 00-teensy.rules from: https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/00-teensy.rules
2. save it as  00-teensy.rules inside /lib/udev/rules.d
3. download already compiled .hex files of LED blink, slow & fast from: https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/blink_both.zip
4. Download teensy program (64 bit) for debian x64 from : https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensy_linux64.tar.gz

5. Unzip teensy program and run teensy from gui

6. Open HEX file and upload any .hex file from the blink_both folder (Must upload the suitable file compiled for your teensy version e.g blink_slow_teensy35.hex for teensy 3.5)
7. Select "Program" from the "Operations" menu, or click the Program button on the tool bar. The download should be very quick, perhaps too fast to see a tiny progress bar appear, but you should see the "Download Complete" message.

8. Choose "Reboot" from the "Operations" menu, or click the Reboot button on the tool bar. Your Teensy board should immediately begin running the fast LED blink program.

Finally you can now build and upload your own projects on teensy from vsCode, Arduino etc. on linux distribution.
